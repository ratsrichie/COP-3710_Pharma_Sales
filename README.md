# COP-3710 Pharma Sales Database

_Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical Sales Database Application (using the Kaggle “Pharma sales data” dataset by Milan Dravkovic)_

# Domain 

A data analysis by selecting the pharma sales dataset from Kaggle made by Milan Dravkovic.The project will leverage real transactional pharmaceutical sales records to extract insights, build analytical models, and possibly support forecasting and business decision-making.

# High Level Goals 

The database app will focus on sales tracking + analytics, like:
-Store daily sales records (date + sales amounts per drug category).
-Support reporting queries, for example:
     -total sales by month/year
     -busiest weekday patterns
     -top-selling ATC categories
     -trends over time (useful later for window functions like running totals)

Help a “manager” user answer inventory and stock information.
